## 🧠 Challenges and Learning Outcomes

Building this portfolio was a fantastic learning experience. Here are some of the key challenges I faced and what I learned:

-   **Implementing the Language Switcher:** The biggest challenge was creating a scalable system for translations. I learned how to structure language data in a JavaScript object and dynamically update the DOM, which solidified my understanding of DOM manipulation and data structures.
-   **State Management for Theme:** Persisting the user's choice for dark/light mode across sessions was a great introduction to using `localStorage`. I learned how to save and retrieve user preferences to create a more personalized experience.
-   **CSS Architecture:** Keeping the CSS organized and maintainable was a priority. I practiced using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming conventions and structuring my styles logically to avoid conflicts.
